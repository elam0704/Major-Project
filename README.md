## Chosen Method – User Input
###### In my approach, I focus on creating an interactive experience by using key inputs and selecting only a few main elements from Mondrian's artwork. Specifically, I've chosen to incorporate the yellow lines and the three larger rectangles as the main animated features. My approach to the artwork is significantly different from the other group members, where their design primarily involves changes in component sizes, colours, and reveal elements at different times, my approach introduces a game-based interaction. Instead of drawing the full piece, I’ve simplified the design by adapting only key elements to avoid visual overload.

###### I've always been a fan of rhythm games, like *Magic Tiles* and *Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat*, which inspire my concept. With influences from both these games and Mondrian's work, I aim to create a rhythm game where blocks drop from the three main elements in the centre, challenging the user to catch them in time.
